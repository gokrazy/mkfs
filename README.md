# gokrazy mkfs

This program is intended to be run on gokrazy only, where it will create an ext4
file system on the perm partition and then reboot your system. If `/perm` is
already mounted, the program will exit without changing anything.

The gokrazy mkfs program includes a static build of the `mke2fs` and `e2fsck`
programs from the `e2fsprogs` package.

## Usage

You can either add this program to your gokrazy instance:

```
gok add github.com/gokrazy/mkfs
```

â€¦or, if you want to run it only once without otherwise including it in your
installation, you can use `gok run`:

```
git clone https://github.com/gokrazy/mkfs
cd mkfs
gok -i bakery run
```
